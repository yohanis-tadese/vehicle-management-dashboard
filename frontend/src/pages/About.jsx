          Project Purpose
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-3">
          This project was developed as part of a mini-project submission for a
          potential client. The client is seeking a MERN stack developer to
          build a **Fleet Management System**, and this dashboard serves as a
          proof of concept for the final system.
          <br />
          This project was completed in just one day to showcase the development
          speed and capabilities. It is a proof of our dedication and
          efficiency!
